# House Price Prediction
House price prediction is a machine learning task that involves estimating the selling price of residential properties based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms. It is a type of regression problem where the goal is to build a model that can learn from historical housing data and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. This type of prediction is highly valuable in the real estate industry, helping buyers, sellers, investors, and financial institutions make informed decisions. By analyzing trends and relationships within the data, predictive models can provide insights into market behavior and support more efficient and data-driven property valuations.<br>

# About this project
This project aims to predict house
prices in Guwahati using a machine learning models, I have use several machine learning algorithm such as Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, Support Vector Machine etc but specifically used Linear Regression model. Linear
regression is a fundamental and widely used algorithm
for predictive modeling, particularly in cases where the
relationship between the dependent variable (house
prices) and independent variables (factors such as size,
location, number of rooms, etc.) is assumed to be
linear, The choice of linear regression is ideal for this
project due to its simplicity and interpretability.
